**<h3>Pentesting Ethics</h3>**
+ Pentesting is an authorized audit of a computer system's security and defences as agreed by the owners of the systems.
+ <strong>White Hat:</strong> These hackers are considered the "good people". They remain within the law and use their skills to benefit others.
+ <strong>Grey Hat:</strong> These people use their skills to benefit others often; however, they do not respect/follow the law or ethical standards at all times.
+ <strong>Black Hat:</strong> These people are criminals and often seek to damage organisations or gain some form of financial benefit at the cost of others.

<h3>Rules of Engagement</h3>
- <strong>Permission:</strong> This section of the document gives explicit permission for the engagement to be carried out. This permission is essential to legally protect individuals and organisations for the activities they carry out.
- <strong>Test Scope:</strong> This section of the document will annotate specific targets to which the engagement should apply. For example, the penetration test may only apply to certain servers or applications but not the entire network.
- <strong>Rules:</strong> The rules section will define exactly the techniques that are permitted during the engagement. For example, the rules may specifically state that techniques such as phishing attacks are prohibited, but MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks are okay.

<h3>Pentesting Methodologies</h3>
- <strong>Information Gathering:</strong> This stage involves collecting as much publically accessible information about a target/organisation as possible, for example, OSINT and research.
- <strong>Enumeration/Scanning:</strong> This stage involves discovering applications and services running on the systems. For example, finding a web server that may be potentially vulnerable.
- <strong>Exploitation:</strong> This stage involves leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application. This stage can involve the use of public exploits or exploiting application logic.
- <strong>Privilege Escalation:</strong> Once you have successfully exploited a system or application (known as a foothold), this stage is the attempt to expand your access to a system. You can escalate horizontally and vertically, where horizontally is accessing another account of the same permission group (i.e. another user), whereas vertically is that of another permission group (i.e. an administrator).
- <strong>Post-Exploitation:</strong> This stage involves a few sub-stages:  
	1. What other hosts can be targeted (pivoting)
	2. What additional information can we gather from the host now that we are a privileged user
	3.  Covering your tracks
	4. Reporting

<h3>Box Pentesting</h3>
- <strong>Black Box Testing:</strong> This testing process is a high-level process where the tester is not given any information about the inner workings of the application or service.
- <strong> Grey-Box Testing:</strong> The tester will have some limited knowledge of the internal components of the application or piece of software.
- <strong> White-Box Testing:</strong> The tester will have **full** knowledge of the application and its expected behaviour and is much more time consuming than black-box testing.
