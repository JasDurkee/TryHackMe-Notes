+ Burp Suite Community Edition:
	+ <strong>Proxy</strong>: Burp Proxy allows us to intercept and modify requests/responses when interacting with web applications.
	+ <strong>Repeater</strong>: Allows us to capture, modify, then resend the same request numerous times.
	+ <strong>Intruder</strong>: Allows us to spray an endpoint with requests. This is often used for bruteforce attacks or to fuzz endpoints.
	+ <strong>Decoder</strong>: Decode captured information, or encode a payload prior to sending it to the target
	+ <strong>Comparer</strong>: Allows us to compare two pieces of data at either word or byte level.
	+ <strong>Sequencer</strong>: Allows us to assess the randomness of tokens such as session cookie values or other supposedly random generated data
